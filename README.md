Personality Prediction System via CV Analysis

The Five Major Personality Traits The model assesses five major aspects of people's personalities:

1. Openness: also known as "Intellect" or "Imagination," this trait assesses your level of inventiveness as well as your quest for information and new experiences. 

2. Conscientiousness: this examines your level of concern in your life and work. If you have a high conscientiousness score, you are likely to be organised and meticulous, and you know how to make and follow through on plans. If you get a low score, you're probably lazy and disorganised. 

3. Extraversion/Introversion: This dimension assesses your social abilities. For example, are you outgoing or quiet? Do you get your energy from a crowd, or do you struggle to work and connect with others? 

4. Agreeability: this factor assesses how well you get along with others. Are you thoughtful, helpful, and open to compromise? Or do you prioritise your own needs over those of others? 

5. Natural Reactions: Also known as "Emotional Stability" or "Neuroticism," this metric measures emotional reactions. Do you react negatively or calmly when you hear bad news? Do you concentrate about minor details, or do you remain calm in stressful situations?
